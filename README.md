# Git Practice with Codecademy

To learn how to use Git properly I started a course with Codecademy. In this course I learned

  - how to work with the terminal
  - what Git and GitHub are
  - how to set up a git repository using Git and GitHub
  - Markup

and finally, during the course this project developed.

Since I started my **apprenticeship as a software developer** in August 2022 and haven't gotten the chance to learn Git in a way
that me and my work efficiency would benefit from. So I wanted to take action and started learning it my freetime.
Now, I am finally able to understand why I kept making the same mistakes over and over again, not understanding why.
I **mastered the basics* so that I can finally *fix my mistakes* and *keep improving* without having to go back troubleshooting all the time.
