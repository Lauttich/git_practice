# Git Practice with Codecademy

To learn how to use Git properly I started a course with Codecademy. In this course I learned

  - how to work with the terminal
  - what Git and GitHub are
  - How to set up a git repository using Git and GitHub
  - Markup

and finally, during the course this project developed.

Since I started my **apprenticeship as a software developer** in August 2022 and haven't gotten the chance to learn Git in a way
that I could use it properly, I wanted to take action and learn it on my own terms. So here we are, and I am enjoying it.
I am finally able to understand why I kept making the same mistakes over and over again, not understanding why.
Now I **mastered the basics* so that I can *fix the mistakes* I made and *keep improving*.

So far there is no code in here, but there's *work in progress*.
